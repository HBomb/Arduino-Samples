Contains sample code for a simple app that controls an Arduino via
your iPhone (using OSC and Processing in between).

The “libraries” directory contains the OSC library and needs to be placed 
in your Processing development project directory. “sketch_LEDControl.pde” 
is the Processing sketch and “sketch_LightLED.pde” is the Arduino sketch.
